# Code sharing as an Early Career Researcher: the good, the bad & the ugly!
## Overview of materials in this repository:

Are you an Early Career Researcher at UCL who wants to find out more about code sharing? Would you like a simple introduction to sharing code through GitHub repositories? 

This repository covers materials on code sharing as an early career reseracher, based on a session organised by Rachel Pearson, Dr Louise Mc Grath-Lone and Dr Ania Zylbersztejn on behalf of the Child Health Informatics Group (CHIG) for the UCL Festival of Code 2021. 

This repository includes:
- slides used during the session; you can view them on GitHub, but you will need to download the powerpoint to access all links. 
- a recording of our quick tutorial on getting started with GitHub [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/ea6f7032-5101-4437-9616-47260dfcaec3)
- list of links to useful resources (at the bottom)


## Festival of Code 2021
In July 2021, we held a session on code sharing as part of the UCL Festival of Code. In the session, we shared our experiences of code sharing (the good, the bad and the ugly!) and invited discussion around how code sharing can be encouraged at UCL, recognising the unique challenges that Early Career Researchers face. We also offered some practical advice about how we set up GitHub repositories to share code, both within our group and with the wider research community. We were thrilled to have almost 90 attendees from 9 out of UCL’s 11 faculties. We summarised the benefits and barriers to code sharing and the views that participants shared in this [blog post](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/open-access/2021/09/14/code-sharing-as-an-ecr/)
