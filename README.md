# UCL Festival of Code 2021
## Code sharing as an Early Career Researcher: the good, the bad & the ugly!

Are you an Early Career Researcher at UCL who wants to find out more about code sharing? Would you like a simple introduction to sharing code through GitHub repositories? This repository covers materials from session on code sharing as an early career reseracher organised by Rachel Pearson, Dr Louise Mc Grath-Lone and Dr Ania Zylbersztejn on behalf of the Child Health Informatics Group (CHIG) for the UCL Festival of Code 2021. 

In this session, we shared our experiences of code sharing (the good, the bad and the ugly!) and invited discussion around how code sharing can be encouraged at UCL, recognising the unique challenges that Early Career Researchers face. We also offered some practical advice about how we set up GitHub repositories to share code, both within our group and with the wider research community.

## Overview of materials in this repository:
- Augmented presentation (PDF) with links to useful resources
- An example of Stata do-file template for formatting
- You can also watch a quick tutorial on getting started with GitHub from the session [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/ea6f7032-5101-4437-9616-47260dfcaec3)
